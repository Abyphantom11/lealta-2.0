Asunto: Request checkout access and sandbox environment

---

Hi Paddle Support Team,

I have a fully verified live account but I'm facing two issues:

1. CHECKOUTS BLOCKED IN LIVE
   - Error: 403 Forbidden when creating checkouts
   - Message: "Transaction checkout creation is blocked for this vendor"
   - My account is fully verified (4/4) with all business info complete
   
2. NO ACCESS TO SANDBOX ENVIRONMENT
   - I cannot switch to sandbox mode in my dashboard
   - I need sandbox for testing before going live

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
✅ Seller ID: 257347
✅ Account Status: Verified (4/4)
✅ Email: abyphntom@gmail.com
✅ Business Name: lealta

BUSINESS INFORMATION:
- Product: Lealta - SaaS platform for restaurant management
- Business Model: Monthly SaaS subscriptions ($250/month)
- Target Market: Restaurants and hospitality businesses
- Expected Volume: 5-10 customers per month initially

REQUESTS:
1. Please enable checkout creation for my live account
2. Please provide access to a sandbox/test environment

I'm ready to start accepting payments and would appreciate your help enabling these features.

Thank you!

Best regards,
