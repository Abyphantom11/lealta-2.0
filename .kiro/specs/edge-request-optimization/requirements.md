# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The system is experiencing excessive edge requests on Vercel, with nearly 500,000 requests on October 8th alone. This represents a critical performance and cost optimization issue that needs immediate attention. The feature will analyze current edge request patterns, identify the root causes, and implement optimizations to reduce unnecessary requests while maintaining system functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to identify what is causing excessive edge requests, so that I can understand the root cause of the performance issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing edge request patterns THEN the system SHALL identify the top 5 endpoints generating the most requests
2. WHEN examining request frequency THEN the system SHALL determine if requests are coming from polling, real-time updates, or user interactions
3. WHEN reviewing middleware execution THEN the system SHALL identify if middleware.ts is being triggered excessively
4. IF requests are coming from API routes THEN the system SHALL categorize them by business logic vs infrastructure calls
5. WHEN analyzing request timing THEN the system SHALL identify peak usage patterns and potential automated processes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement request caching and optimization strategies, so that I can reduce redundant edge requests without affecting user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing API response caching THEN the system SHALL cache frequently requested data for appropriate durations
2. WHEN optimizing polling mechanisms THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff or reduce polling frequency
3. WHEN handling static content THEN the system SHALL ensure proper CDN caching headers are set
4. IF real-time updates are needed THEN the system SHALL evaluate WebSocket or Server-Sent Events as alternatives to polling
5. WHEN implementing request deduplication THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate requests within short time windows

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor and alert on edge request usage, so that I can prevent future cost overruns and performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring edge requests THEN the system SHALL track daily request counts and alert when thresholds are exceeded
2. WHEN analyzing request patterns THEN the system SHALL provide dashboards showing request distribution by endpoint
3. WHEN detecting anomalies THEN the system SHALL alert administrators of unusual request spikes
4. IF request limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent overages
5. WHEN optimizations are applied THEN the system SHALL measure and report the reduction in edge requests

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the middleware and routing logic, so that unnecessary edge function executions are eliminated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing requests THEN the middleware SHALL only execute for routes that actually require it
2. WHEN handling static assets THEN the system SHALL bypass edge functions when possible
3. WHEN implementing route optimization THEN the system SHALL use static generation where appropriate
4. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL cache authentication checks to reduce repeated validations
5. WHEN optimizing business routing THEN the system SHALL minimize database calls in middleware

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to maintain performance while reducing costs, so that the application remains responsive without excessive infrastructure expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimizations are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain current response times or improve them
2. WHEN reducing edge requests THEN the system SHALL not impact user experience or functionality
3. WHEN implementing caching THEN the system SHALL ensure data freshness requirements are met
4. IF performance degrades THEN the system SHALL provide rollback mechanisms
5. WHEN measuring success THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 70% reduction in edge requests while maintaining functionality
